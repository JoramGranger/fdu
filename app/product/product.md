When building a product-focused feature in a Next.js project using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, you’ll want to structure your project with a combination of components, sections, and screens that make the codebase organized and maintainable. Here’s an outline of what you might need:

1. Pages
pages/products/index.tsx: Displays a list of products. This page might include filters, sorting options, and pagination.
pages/products/[id].tsx: Displays a single product's details. This might include images, description, pricing, reviews, and related products.
2. Components
ProductCard.tsx: A reusable component for displaying individual product information in a grid or list. It might include an image, name, price, and a quick add-to-cart button.
ProductImage.tsx: A component specifically for rendering product images, possibly with zoom or carousel functionality.
ProductPrice.tsx: A component to display the product's price, including options for discounts or special offers.
AddToCartButton.tsx: A button component that handles adding products to the shopping cart, possibly including some UI feedback (e.g., loading spinner).
RatingStars.tsx: A component that displays the star rating of a product.
ProductFilter.tsx: A component for filtering products by category, price range, brand, etc.
ProductSort.tsx: A dropdown or set of buttons for sorting products (e.g., by price, popularity, etc.).
ProductReview.tsx: A component to display individual product reviews.
3. Sections
ProductList.tsx: A section that contains and manages the display of a list/grid of ProductCard components.
ProductDetails.tsx: A section for the detailed view of a product, including its images, descriptions, and other relevant information.
RelatedProducts.tsx: A section that shows related products, possibly in a carousel or grid layout.
ProductSpecifications.tsx: A section to display detailed specifications of a product (e.g., dimensions, materials, etc.).
CustomerReviews.tsx: A section for displaying and managing customer reviews for a product.
ProductDescription.tsx: A section specifically for the detailed description of the product.
4. Screens
ProductListScreen.tsx: The main screen that combines components like ProductFilter, ProductSort, and ProductList to create the full product list experience.
ProductDetailsScreen.tsx: The screen that combines ProductDetails, ProductSpecifications, RelatedProducts, and CustomerReviews to present all information about a single product.
5. Utilities (optional)
utils/currencyFormatter.ts: A utility function to format prices.
utils/ratingsCalculator.ts: A utility function to calculate average ratings from an array of reviews.
6. Styles
Since you’re using Tailwind CSS, you might not have separate CSS files. However, you can create utility classes or use Tailwind’s @apply directive in a global CSS file if needed
